AXI-Lite Write Channel Timing + Response

Signals (ACLK, ARESETn):
AW: AWVALID, AWREADY
W: WVALID, WREADY
B: BVALID, BREADY, BRESP[1:0]
Rules:
	1.	When both address & data are accepted (AWVALID&&AWREADY && WVALID&&WREADY in the same cycle or over time), a BVALID must appear within 1â€“8 ACLK cycles.
	2.	BVALID must not assert before both AW and W handshakes are completed.
	3.	While BVALID==1, BRESP must be stable until handshake (BREADY).
	4.	Cover: min-latency response (1) and max-latency response (8).
